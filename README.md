# pandas-challenge
here's my pandas challenge for module 4

I wrote the analysis on the jupyter notebook, but I will include this here as well. 

Analysis:
 # PyCity Schools Analysis

Analysis: (summarizes the data and notes two observable trends based on the data)

In PyCitySchools, we compare the differences in our city's school district in terms of standarized test scores. The categories are reading and math and in this data, we look further into score averages per school, passing scores: based on budget, school size, school type and more. 

From the data, we can observe that charter schools have more success in terms of passing students. A possible reason we can derive based on the data is that charter schools tend to have a fewer amount of total students compared to districts. They most likley have fewer students to focus more of their attention on in terms of academics.
 We can also note that because these charter schools are given a smaller budget, they are most likley more wise with the distribution of the budget per student. Its possible that although districts may have a higher budget, it may be harder to guide/improve the academics of each student in a larger population.
